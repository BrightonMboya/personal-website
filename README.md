This is the source code for my personal portfolio.

### Source Information

This website is built with

- [Svelte (Frontend Framework)](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Slickscroll (Scroll Effects)](https://github.com/Musab-Hassan/slickscrolljs)
- [Anime (Animations)](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime)
- [Three.js (3D Effects)](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

### NB

Most of the animations in this repo are just an overkill ngl.
The animations in the work sections can be reproduced by using threejs.
Just create a mesh and make the image the material. Then you can animate it using the sin(x) eqn or similar trig equation.
The ease in and ease out on clicking can be also achieved with css or with framer motion library.
